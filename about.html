    <h1>Our Company goals</h1>
    <h2>would be to have a drone that is top tier, but that is also accessible to the community. We want to have the community happy with what we are selling them, so why not have a drone that has all of the features of a top tier $11,000 drone in like a hundred dollar drone. Personally we want people to come buy from us and not the competitors. So another goal is to have the drones affordable and have a good review from the consumers. We also want to have a good battery life so you can use your drone for 2, 3, 4 hours or maybe more.
    
    Some of  our personal goals would include: having good time management for when the drone can get fixed, and good communication skills with the consumers if they have a problem. The reason why we would need good communication for the company is because we want the people to come back and to buy more parts, cameras for the drone and so on.
