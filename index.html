<h1>Why you should buy a drone</h1>
<h2>As you know drones are becoming a big part of today's society so for our targets would be anyone really, if you think about this anyone can use a photograph drone. Police would be a good example of this because drones can help with a r.i.p(Robbery in progress) or it can help track a stolen vehicle or a high speed chase if the perpetrators get away, and or examining the outer area to see if there is any possible entrance point to a school if there is an active shooter.
    Another good example would be Influenceres on tik tok, Instagram, Youtube, Twitch and many other social media platforms. It would help them out if they wanted to get a far away shot or they wanted to make an epic drone shot for youtube. It would help out people if they wanted to get any aerial shot if they wanted to make a nice video only part of your video for Youtube and other social media.
    A good example would be amazon doing drone delivery. The drone delivery would help out drivers alot when there are just a couple of small items that have been ordered. The scenario would be to say Timmy ordered ten rings that weigh no more than 3.8 pounds, so instead of sending out a driver to Timmys house they can just send a drone since it would be able to carry the ten rings page. Drone delivery can save drivers on gas, vehicle maintenance, and oil changes.
    A great example of usage of drones would be during the peak of covid,Chula Vista did this when covid was at its peak. What they did was the Sheriff department bought 2 11,000 US dollar drones and went around and got people's body temperatures and told them to go home if they're body temperature was x amount of degrees.</h2>
